    <h1>Creative Writing</h1>
    <p>
      Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get
      their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no
      idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
      forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common
      writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a
      short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random
      paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
      have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
      matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to
      use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.

    <h2>Tackle Writers' Block</h2>
    <p>
      A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle
      writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a
      current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a
      completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of
      the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first
      place.
